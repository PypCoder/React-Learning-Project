Project Overview
In this project, we explore the basics of React. If you're new to setting up a React environment, refer to the REACT-SETUP-README.md file for instructions. The project demonstrates essential React concepts, including components, function-based components, state management, event handling, conditional rendering, props, and Bootstrap for styling. Below is a detailed breakdown of each concept and an introduction to React’s core features.

Introduction to React
React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications (SPAs). Its component-based architecture allows developers to build web applications as collections of reusable, self-contained components. Unlike traditional, multi-page applications that require the server to reload the entire page upon each interaction, React enables a dynamic user experience where only specific parts of the page update, making the app feel faster and more responsive.

Single-Page Applications (SPAs) vs. Multi-Page Applications (MPAs):

SPAs: In a single-page application, the initial page load retrieves most of the content, and React dynamically updates sections of the page without requiring a full reload. This approach results in smoother, app-like experiences within the browser.
MPAs: Multi-page applications load a new HTML page from the server each time the user navigates to a different part of the app. While this is straightforward, it can be slower as each interaction with the site may require a new server request and page reload.
React’s component structure and its use of a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) are key to its efficiency. The virtual DOM detects changes and only updates the necessary elements on the page, improving performance and reducing unnecessary re-rendering.

Concepts Used
1. React Components
Components are the building blocks of a React project. They allow us to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces that can be managed separately and used across various parts of the project or even in different projects. Each component handles its own logic and renders a part of the UI. This project includes two main components: Mood and Navbar. You can view their code in src/Components.

Example Code:

// src/Components/Navbar.js
import React from 'react';

function Navbar() {
    return (
        <nav>
            <h1>My React App</h1>
        </nav>
    );
}

export default Navbar;
2. Props
Props (short for "properties") are values passed to components from their parent component. They function similarly to parameters in JavaScript functions, allowing data to be transferred and customized based on what’s passed in. Props can be accessed anywhere within the component, making them flexible and powerful for managing data between components.

Example Code:

// src/Components/Mood.js
import React from 'react';

function Mood({ mood }) { // mood is the prop
    return (
        <p>Current mood: {mood}</p>
    );
}

export default Mood;
Usage:

// In App.js
<Mood mood="Happy" />
3. State
State is the internal data of a component, representing its current condition or status. Unlike props, which are passed to the component, state is managed and updated within the component itself. State is essential for dynamic data and can change over time, such as text input in a text area. This project uses React’s useState hook to handle state changes within components.

Example Code:

// src/Components/TextArea.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function TextArea() {
    const [text, setText] = useState('');

    return (
        <textarea 
            value={text} 
            onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} 
            placeholder="Type something..."
        />
    );
}

export default TextArea;
4. Event Handling
React provides an efficient way to handle events such as button clicks, form submissions, and other user actions. Event handlers in React are defined as functions and passed directly to the element as properties. This enables us to manage user interactions within the UI.

Example Code:

// src/Components/SubmitButton.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function SubmitButton() {
    const [message, setMessage] = useState('Click the button');

    const handleClick = () => {
        setMessage('Button clicked!');
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
            <p>{message}</p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default SubmitButton;
5. Conditional Rendering
Conditional rendering in React allows components to display different content based on certain conditions, making the UI responsive and interactive. By using simple JavaScript conditions, we can decide which elements or components should be displayed based on the current state or props.

Example Code:

// src/Components/UserStatus.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function UserStatus() {
    const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(false);

    return (
        <div>
            {isLoggedIn ? <p>Welcome back!</p> : <p>Please log in</p>}
            <button onClick={() => setIsLoggedIn(!isLoggedIn)}>
                {isLoggedIn ? "Logout" : "Login"}
            </button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default UserStatus;
Summary
This project demonstrates fundamental React concepts through a series of functional components. By understanding components, props, state, event handling, and conditional rendering, you’ll have a solid foundation to build more complex React applications.
